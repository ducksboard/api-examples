Bash example
============

We will show you how to push data to Ducksboard using your terminal


Requirements
---------------

You'll need:

* a Ducksboard account with API access
* a bash terminal

Easy ;) 

Before starting 
------------------

It's recommended to create some custom widgets ordered to recreate this screensot:

As you can see, the kind of custom widgets used are:

* Numbers -> Counter
* Numbers -> Gauge
* Numbers -> Double Gauge
* Numbers -> Graph
* Numbers -> Boxes
* Numbers -> Pins
* Numbers -> Bars
* Text -> Timeline
* Images -> Image
* Images -> Small image

Once created, remember to fill the values of the widgets you'll use and your APIKEY at "vars.sh". If you don't do this, this script won't work :(  

Running
----------

Just give executing permission to "bars.sh" and run it :)

If everything is OK, you'll see this screen:
