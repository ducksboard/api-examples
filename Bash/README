Bash example
============

We will show you how to push data to Ducksboard using your terminal


1. Requirements
---------------

You'll need:

* a Ducksboard account with API access
* a bash terminal

Easy ;) 

2. Before starting 
------------------

You'll need to create some custom widgets ordered laid out this way to recreate this screensot: 
<img style="align:right" width=400 src="https://github.com/ducksboard/API-Examples/raw/master/Bash/bash_dashboard_screenshot.png" />

As you can see, the kinds of custom widgets used are:

* Numbers -> Counter
* Numbers -> Gauge
* Numbers -> Double Gauge
* Numbers -> Graph
* Text -> Timeline
* Images -> Image
* Images -> Small image

Once created, remember to edit "vars.sh" and fill in your widgets' IDs and API-KEY. If you don't do this, this script won't work :(  

3. Running
----------

Just execute "bash.sh" :)

If everything is OK, you'll see this screen:
